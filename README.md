## E-Ticketing Service
You've been tasked to develop a streamlined e-ticketing solution for concerts, sporting events, and theater
performances. This service aims to revolutionize the ticket purchasing process, offering a smooth and secure
way for patrons to secure their spots at sought-after events.
## Backend (Express.js)
1. Design API endpoints to manage events, each with details like name, date, time, venue, and ticket
availability.
2. Implement authentication and authorization to differentiate between regular patrons and
administrators.
3. Enable patrons to browse available events, view event details, and select specific seats.
4. Develop a secure checkout process for ticket purchase using simulated payment integration.
5. Create a dashboard for administrators to add new events, update event details, and manage ticket
inventory.
6. Allow patrons to receive email notifications for ticket confirmations and event updates.
7. Implement a mechanism to log all API requests and responses for debugging and monitoring
purposes.
8. Ensure that API endpoints are well-documented using a tool like Swagger.
9. Restrict patron access to certain actions like modifying event details or managing other patron's
bookings.

10. Set up a system to prevent multiple ticket purchases for the same seat within an event.


## Frontend (React.js)
1. Develop a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching available events.
2. Create a reusable component to display event details with an interactive seat map for selection.
3. Design a secure form for patrons to register an account and manage their profiles.
4. Implement a checkout page where patrons can review their selected tickets and proceed with the
purchase.
5. Create a dynamic profile section for patrons to view their order history and download tickets.
6. Develop a mechanism to provide visual feedback to the patron during the ticket booking process.
7. Utilize a state management solution to effectively share data between components.
8. Implement smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.
9. Ensure that form inputs are validated before submission to prevent invalid data from reaching the backend.
10. Design a comprehensive error handling system to gracefully display error messages to the patron.

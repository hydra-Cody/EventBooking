## E-Ticketing Service
You've been tasked to develop a streamlined e-ticketing solution for concerts, sporting events, and theater
performances. This service aims to revolutionize the ticket purchasing process, offering a smooth and secure
way for patrons to secure their spots at sought-after events.



## Frontend (React.js)
1. Develop a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching available events.
2. Create a reusable component to display event details with an interactive seat map for selection.
3. Design a secure form for patrons to register an account and manage their profiles.
4. Implement a checkout page where patrons can review their selected tickets and proceed with the
purchase.
5. Create a dynamic profile section for patrons to view their order history and download tickets.
6. Develop a mechanism to provide visual feedback to the patron during the ticket booking process.
7. Utilize a state management solution to effectively share data between components.
8. Implement smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.
9. Ensure that form inputs are validated before submission to prevent invalid data from reaching the backend.
10. Design a comprehensive error handling system to gracefully display error messages to the patron.
